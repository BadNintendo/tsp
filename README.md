### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Overview

In the context of solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), using a technique called **memoization** to improve efficiency. This involves storing previously calculated distances between cities so we donâ€™t have to recalculate them every time.

#### Understanding `memoizedDistances`

- **Purpose**: The `memoizedDistances` variable is used to store the distances between pairs of cities after they are calculated for the first time. This way, if we need the distance again, we can simply retrieve it from memory instead of recalculating it, which saves time and resources.

- **Memory Management**: 
  - If you want to clear the stored distances, you can reset `memoizedDistances` to an empty object. 
  - It's important to note that if you find yourself frequently changing the values stored in `memoizedDistances`, you might consider changing its declaration from `const` to `let`. This allows you to update or modify the contents as needed.

### Summary

By effectively using memoization with the `memoizedDistances` object, you can significantly enhance the performance of your TSP solution. This technique minimizes redundant calculations and optimizes memory usage, making your implementation more efficient.
