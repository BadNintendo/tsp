2. Commercial Use Restrictions  
    - Commercial Use Prohibition: You may not use the Software or any derivative works of the Software for any form of commercial gain, profit, or revenue-generating activities, including but not limited to selling, licensing, distributing, or incorporating the Software into a product or service for sale, without prior written consent from the copyright holder.
    - Commercial License Requirement: Any use of the Software for commercial purposes requires a separate commercial license. Contact the original author for commercial use approval.

3. Revenue Sharing for Commercial Use  
If you have obtained consent or a commercial license to use the Software and any modifications to the Software generate profit or revenue, you agree to the following contribution terms:
    - Contribution Fee: You are required to pay 5% of the total gross revenue generated from the Software or any derivative works thereof. This applies to any first implementations or revenue-generating products incorporating the Software or parts of it. Revenue from In-Game Rewards or Currency: Any use of the Software that generates virtual currency, rewards, redeemable items, or similar benefits that have monetary value will also be subject to the 5% contribution.
    - Revenue Cap Reduction: If your total gross revenue exceeds $1 million in proceeds, the contribution fee is reduced to 3% for all proceeds beyond the $1 million threshold.
    - Acknowledgment of Contribution: Companies using the Software must acknowledge the contribution and provide visible credit to the original author, Badnintendo, and TSP in any public materials or products.

4. Copyright and Attribution  
    - Preservation of Copyright: You may not remove, alter, or obscure any copyright notices, attributions, or remarks in the Software. All parts of the Software, including modules and JavaScript code, must retain the original copyright notices.
    - Author Attribution: All changes or modifications to the Software must retain attribution to the original author, Badnintendo, as the creator of the Software. You may shorten comments and minimize inline documentation for readability, but any comments containing copyright or attribution information must remain intact.
    - Minimum Attribution: In cases where inline comments are too large, the attribution must at least contain the name of the author and a brief reference to the copyright, for example, “Original Code by Badnintendo, Copyright (c) TSP 2024.”

Legal action may be pursued to recover damages or enforce this agreement.

7. Prohibited Users  
Companies such as Amazon, Twitch, or any entities associated with Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos are explicitly prohibited from using any part of the Software or its concepts, even if they follow the license terms. These companies are considered irrelevant on the scales of time and are not permitted to use the Software in any capacity.
