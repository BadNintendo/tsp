To speed up solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on larger datasets, you can introduce **categorization and indexing of locally stored data**. Here’s a clearer breakdown of how this approach might work:

### 1. Efficient Data Categorization and Lookup
   - **Categorize and Index Data**: First, organize your data by categories (such as alphabetical or numerical identifiers) to narrow down search paths quickly. For instance, if cities have names starting with certain letters or belong to specific numeric coordinates, group them accordingly.
   - **Store Known Distances**: After calculating distances once, save them in a lookup table or a local database. Next time, instead of recalculating, retrieve the precomputed values, saving computational time.

### 2. Applying Query Optimization
   - When the TSP algorithm queries a route or distance, it checks the locally stored results to see if it’s already been computed. If it has, your solution can skip recalculating it and just use the stored value. This is **memoization** on a larger scale and helps with quick lookups.
   - For larger datasets, this method can cut down redundant calculations, especially when similar or overlapping routes are involved.

### 3. Faster Execution Without Proving P = NP
   - This method won’t necessarily validate **P = NP**, since your approach is an optimization for specific cases. While categorizing data may speed up calculations, it doesn’t reduce the problem to a polynomial-time complexity for every dataset.
   - The **1 million dollar Clay prize** requires proof that a solution exists for all cases in polynomial time, not just specific instances. Thus, even if you solve TSP faster with optimizations, it doesn’t satisfy the conditions for claiming the prize.

### Conclusion
In other words, your approach can improve execution time, especially on specific data structures or datasets. However, without proving a universal polynomial-time solution, it won't solve the **P = NP** question, nor claim the prize—it's more of a smart way to handle TSP practically, making your work efficient for real-world cases but not universally optimal for the theoretical problem. 

Good luck with refining your approach!
