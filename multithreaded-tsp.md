To process a large dataset (like the roadmap of cities in TSP) in a way that avoids overwhelming CPU usage, we can use a strategic approach that breaks down the data into manageable chunks and processes them in parallel. Here’s how we can make this theoretically possible by combining key ideas from P vs NP, asynchronous processing, and parallelization.

### Step 1: Divide and Conquer with Data Partitioning
1. **Partition the Dataset:** 
   - We start by dividing the roadmap data into sections based on logical groupings—such as regions, proximity clusters, or relevant sub-categories. Each of these segments will be processed individually, rather than handling the entire dataset at once.
   - **Example in TSP**: If we have a set of cities, we could group them by state, district, or proximity (e.g., clusters of cities within a certain radius of each other).

2. **Define Boundaries for Segments:**
   - Use clear cutoffs or boundaries between these partitions. In TSP, this means defining clusters that are close enough to be relevant for shorter routes but without including all possible distant cities, keeping calculations focused and contained.

### Step 2: Asynchronous and On-Demand Data Access
1. **Access Data as Needed per Thread**:
   - When processing each segment, load only the necessary subset of data at any given time, utilizing asynchronous data calls to pull in smaller chunks of information on demand. This prevents the need to load the entire dataset into memory, keeping CPU usage lower and memory use more efficient.
   - **Practical Example**: For each city group, load only its immediate neighboring cities’ data, process those, and expand outwards only if required for further route calculations.

2. **Use Asynchronous I/O to Avoid CPU Bottleneck**:
   - Async I/O ensures that when data from one cluster is processed, other threads can simultaneously pull in data for additional clusters without waiting, maximizing CPU usage across threads and minimizing idle time.

### Step 3: Parallel Processing with Distributed Threads
1. **Assign Threads to Each Cluster**:
   - Each group or cluster is assigned a separate thread or set of threads to process the calculations within that cluster. This allows the algorithm to handle multiple clusters in parallel, breaking down the exponential processing requirements.
   - **Example in Multi-Threading**: If you have clusters of cities organized by region, each CPU core can be assigned to handle a region. Instead of processing the entire roadmap, the algorithm focuses on these smaller, parallelized groups.

2. **Limit CPU and Memory Use per Thread**:
   - Threads access only the necessary data per their assigned segment, and as each cluster completes, threads move to the next unprocessed cluster. This staged, concurrent approach allows a large dataset to be processed without maxing out CPU resources all at once.

### Step 4: Prioritize Data Caching for Reusability
1. **Cache Results for Common Queries**:
   - For frequently accessed data, such as distances between commonly traveled city pairs, cache these values locally within each thread. This eliminates redundant calculations for repeated checks within the same cluster and improves efficiency.
   - **Example of Caching**: Store frequently calculated distances within each region’s thread cache, so recalculations aren’t needed if another thread requests similar data.

2. **Inter-Thread Shared Cache for Overlapping Segments**:
   - When clusters overlap, share a global or inter-thread cache to reduce redundancy and allow for efficient reuse of previously computed values, further reducing memory strain.

---

### Step 5: Redundant Multi-Path Access for Fault Tolerance
1. **Build Redundancy with Replicated Data**:
   - Ensure data redundancy by storing backup copies of each cluster in different locations. If one data path or node fails, threads can fall back to a redundant source without halting.
   - **Example for Distributed Redundancy**: Duplicate clusters across multiple servers or nodes, allowing threads to shift to these alternate sources in case of a failure, ensuring continuous operation and avoiding reloading of large datasets.

2. **Sync Updated Data Across Threads**:
   - As threads progress, synchronize any route updates or optimized results across all clusters for consistency. This ensures that when one cluster finishes, the next has access to the most recent data, maintaining an up-to-date pathfinding model.

---

### Step 6: Bringing it All Together: A Coordinated System
1. **Master Thread for Coordination**:
   - Use a master thread to manage the distribution and collection of data across threads. This master controls which clusters are being worked on, tracks each thread’s progress, and integrates partial results into the overall solution.
   
2. **Aggregate Results Across Clusters**:
   - As each cluster completes, the results are passed back to the master thread, which coordinates final assembly and optimizations. This integration step combines the segmented results into a complete, optimized roadmap.

### Summary of Approach
This approach combines **data partitioning, asynchronous data loading, parallel processing with threads, caching, redundancy, and centralized coordination** to efficiently handle a large dataset. By breaking the data into smaller, manageable parts and handling each in its own dedicated thread, the algorithm becomes more CPU-efficient, can scale across multiple cores, and provides a resilient solution even when portions of the data or network may be temporarily inaccessible.
